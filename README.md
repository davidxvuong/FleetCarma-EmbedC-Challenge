#FleetCarma Embedded C Challenge

##Summary of Challenge

Write a library in C which will process a set of signals generated by an electric vehicle and compile a trip summary for the vehicle in motion.

The input signals are of the type `vehicle_signal_t`:

```
typedef struct {
    vehicle_signal_type_t signal_type;
    uint64_t unix_timestamp_milliseconds;
    float value;
}vehicle_signal_t;
```

The trip summary structure are of the type `trip_event_summary_t`:

```
typedef struct {
    uint32_t start_time_since_unix_epoch_seconds;
    uint32_t duration_seconds;
    uint32_t distance_travelled_meters;
    uint32_t total_energy_consumed_wh;
    float starting_soc;
    float ending_soc;
}trip_event_summary_t;
```

##Highlights of Implementation

Part of the challenge was to determine the vehicle's distance travelled and the net energy consumed by the vehicle. As a disclaimer, I am not that good at physics, but I still remember some key parts taught in my 1st year physics courses (specifically, [ECE 105](https://uwflow.com/course/ece105) and [ECE 106](https://uwflow.com/course/ece106)).

Recall that the formula for determining speed is the infinitesimal distance divided by the infinitesimal time, or:
