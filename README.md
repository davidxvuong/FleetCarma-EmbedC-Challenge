#FleetCarma Embedded C Challenge

##Summary of Challenge

Write a library in C which will process a set of signals generated by an electric vehicle and compile a trip summary for the vehicle in motion.

The input signals are of the type `vehicle_signal_t`:

```
typedef struct {
    vehicle_signal_type_t signal_type;
    uint64_t unix_timestamp_milliseconds;
    float value;
}vehicle_signal_t;
```

The trip summary structure are of the type `trip_event_summary_t`:

```
typedef struct {
    uint32_t start_time_since_unix_epoch_seconds;
    uint32_t duration_seconds;
    uint32_t distance_travelled_meters;
    uint32_t total_energy_consumed_wh;
    float starting_soc;
    float ending_soc;
}trip_event_summary_t;
```

##Highlights of Implementation

Part of the challenge was to determine the vehicle's distance travelled and the net energy consumed by the vehicle. As a disclaimer, I am not that good at physics, but I still remember some key parts taught in my 1st year physics and calculus courses (specifically, [MATH 117](https://uwflow.com/course/math117) [ECE 105](https://uwflow.com/course/ece105) and [ECE 106](https://uwflow.com/course/ece106)).

Recall that the formula for determining speed is the derivative of distance with respect to time, and and the formula for determining the power is the derivative of energy with respect to time.

Reversing these derivatives will create the formula for distance and energy. The formula for distance is the integral of speed with respect to time, and the formula for energy is the integral of pwoer with respect to time.
